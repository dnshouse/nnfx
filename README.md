# NNFX

This EA is heavily inspired by the No Nonsense Forex way of trading by VP.

The aim of this repo was to write clean and easy to amend OOP MLQ4 code so everybody can fork it and use it as a guide and starting point.

Also it was developed with the idea that you could very easy add or change indicators, so if you are backtesting different setups, and you want to add just another indicator, you could copy paste one of the current indicator wrappers and use it as a template for your new indicator wrapper.

I've optimised it for the main 28 currency pairs for the last few years. It could also be used AS IS.
